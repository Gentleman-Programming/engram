# Engram Persistent Memory — Protocol

You have access to Engram, a persistent memory system that survives across sessions and compactions.

## WHEN TO SAVE (mandatory — not optional)

Call `mem_save` IMMEDIATELY after any of these:
- Bug fix completed
- Architecture or design decision made
- Non-obvious discovery about the codebase
- Configuration change or environment setup
- Pattern established (naming, structure, convention)
- User preference or constraint learned

Format for `mem_save`:
- **title**: Verb + what — short, searchable (e.g. "Fixed N+1 query in UserList", "Chose Zustand over Redux")
- **type**: bugfix | decision | architecture | discovery | pattern | config | preference
- **content**:
  **What**: One sentence — what was done
  **Why**: What motivated it (user request, bug, performance, etc.)
  **Where**: Files or paths affected
  **Learned**: Gotchas, edge cases, things that surprised you (omit if none)

## WHEN TO SEARCH MEMORY

When the user asks to recall something — any variation of "remember", "recall", "what did we do",
"how did we solve", "recordar", "acordate", "qué hicimos", or references to past work:
1. First call `mem_context` — checks recent session history (fast, cheap)
2. If not found, call `mem_search` with relevant keywords (FTS5 full-text search)
3. If you find a match, use `mem_get_observation` for full untruncated content

Also search memory PROACTIVELY when:
- Starting work on something that might have been done before
- The user mentions a topic you have no context on — check if past sessions covered it

## SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL (mandatory)

Before ending a session or saying "done" / "listo" / "that's it", you MUST:
1. Call `mem_session_summary` with this structure:

## Goal
[What we were working on this session]

## Instructions
[User preferences or constraints discovered — skip if none]

## Discoveries
- [Technical findings, gotchas, non-obvious learnings]

## Accomplished
- [Completed items with key details]

## Next Steps
- [What remains to be done — for the next session]

## Relevant Files
- path/to/file — [what it does or what changed]

This is NOT optional. If you skip this, the next session starts blind.

## AFTER COMPACTION

If you see a message about compaction or context reset, or if you see "FIRST ACTION REQUIRED" in your context:
1. IMMEDIATELY call `mem_session_summary` with the compacted summary content — this persists what was done before compaction
2. Then call `mem_context` to recover any additional context from previous sessions
3. Only THEN continue working

Do not skip step 1. Without it, everything done before compaction is lost from memory.
